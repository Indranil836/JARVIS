This was my attempt to make a voice assistant similar to JARVIS (in iron man movie).

   **python**

It can do a lot of cool things, some of them being:



 1.Tells about any person (via Wikipedia)
 
 2.Tell current time and date
 
 3.Open  website
 
 4.Send email (with subject and content)
 
 5.Can switch the window
 
 6.Plays music
 
 7.Open any application on your computer.
